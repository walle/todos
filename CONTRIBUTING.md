Want to contribute? Awesome! Thank you so much.

## How?

There are two ways to help out with this project.

### Help out with implementations

I want to write the code for implementations myself, as this is a learning experience. But pointers are greatly appreciated.

Open up an issue explaining what I'm doing wrong, or how to do it in another way.

### Bugfixes or features for the reference implementation

1. [Fork it](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
